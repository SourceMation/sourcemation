(supporting Java, Kotlin, and Groovy) designed specifically for
building modular microservices and serverless applications. Its key
differentiator is that it performs dependency injection,
configuration, and aspect-oriented programming at compile time

This results in dramatically faster startup times, a much lower memory
footprint, and makes it an ideal choice for serverless functions and
containerized microservices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maven</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/maven/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:03:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/maven/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Maven is a foundational software project management and build
automation tool. Using a central XML configuration file (the pom.xml),
Maven manages all project dependencies (downloading required libraries
from repositories) and executes a standardized build lifecycle (e.g.,
compile, test, package, install, deploy). This
convention-over-configuration approach simplifies the build process,
making it reproducible and standard across all Java-based projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manageiq</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:59:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ManageIQ is an open-source cloud management platform (CMP) that
