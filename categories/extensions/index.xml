secrets from external secret management systems into native
Kubernetes &lt;code&gt;Secret&lt;/code&gt; objects. This allows applications
running in Kubernetes to securely access credentials
stored in platforms like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp
Vault, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By bridging the gap between Kubernetes and these external
systems, it significantly enhances security practices by
centralizing secret management outside the cluster&amp;rsquo;s default
mechanisms. It reduces the need for manual secret rotation
and ensures that sensitive data is handled in a more robust
and compliant manner across your environments. This operator
is essential for modern cloud-native deployments requiring
secure and automated credential provisioning and management.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Matomo</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/matomo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 14:39:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/matomo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Matomo is a leading open-source web analytics platform that is well-known for
