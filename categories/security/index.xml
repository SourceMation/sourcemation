Long-Term Support (LTS) release, and it&amp;rsquo;s intended for end-users or
servers that only need to run pre-compiled Java applications. It
contains the core components, primarily the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
and core class libraries, but omits development tools like the
compiler (javac). Any application running on JRE 21 gains the benefits
of the JDK 21 platform, including the performance improvements from
the finalization of Virtual Threads and other new language features.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Micronaut</title><link>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/micronaut/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:08:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/micronaut/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Description: Micronaut is a modern, full-stack framework for the JVM
(supporting Java, Kotlin, and Groovy) designed specifically for
building modular microservices and serverless applications. Its key
differentiator is that it performs dependency injection,
configuration, and aspect-oriented programming at compile time
(Ahead-of-Time compilation) rather than at runtime using reflection.
This results in dramatically faster startup times, a much lower memory
footprint, and makes it an ideal choice for serverless functions and
containerized microservices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manageiq</title><link>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/manageiq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:59:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/manageiq/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ManageIQ is an open-source cloud management platform (CMP) that
provides a single interface for managing hybrid IT environments. It
discovers and monitors resources across disparate virtualization (like
VMware), private cloud (like OpenStack), and public cloud (like AWS,
Azure) platforms, as well as container platforms like Kubernetes. Its
key features include &amp;ldquo;Insight&amp;rdquo; (discovery, monitoring, analytics),
&amp;ldquo;Control&amp;rdquo; (security, compliance, policy enforcement), and &amp;ldquo;Automate&amp;rdquo;
(provisioning workflows, orchestration). It essentially acts as a
&amp;ldquo;manager of managers,&amp;rdquo; giving administrators a single pane of glass
for governance and automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kong</title><link>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/kong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:47:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/kong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kong is a cloud-native API gateway and platform built on top of Nginx

&amp;ldquo;plugin&amp;rdquo; architecture. By intercepting and proxying all requests, Kong
also provides critical observability metrics, logs, and traces for
monitoring API performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Debian 11 Slim</title><link>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/debian-11-slim/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:44:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/debian-11-slim/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the minimal (&amp;ldquo;slim&amp;rdquo;) variant of the official Docker image for

(like documentation and locales) to create the smallest possible base
for secure, fast-deploying applications. It includes the more modern
toolchain from the &amp;ldquo;Bookworm&amp;rdquo; release, which is built on Linux Kernel
6.1 and includes newer packages like Python 3.11 and PostgreSQL 15,
providing a modern yet highly stable OS layer for new cloud-native
services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helidon</title><link>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/helidon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:33:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.github.io/sourcemation/catalog/helidon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helidon is an open-source, cloud-native set of Java libraries from
