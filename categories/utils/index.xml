Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It contains all administrator goodies like a
load balancer/proxy, libraries, clients and of course the server itself.
OpenLDAP is managed and developed by the OpenLDAP Foundation. OpenLDAP has a
BSD-style license - the OpenLDAP Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenLDAP project started from code from the University of Michigan, the
first release was just cleaned up code from their implementation of LDAP. Over
the years OpenLDAP has grown and now is the de facto standard for LDAP
implementations on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The LDAP
protocol is used for directory services and authentication, and it is widely
used in both educational and corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ZooKeeper</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/zookeeper/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 01:54:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/zookeeper/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Apache ZooKeeper is a well-known high-performance, centralized service
providing coordination primitives. It&amp;rsquo;s frequently used with distributed
applications, as all of them need this kind of synchronization in one form or
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important features provided by ZooKeeper include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronization: Reliable way to coordinate access to shared resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration: Centralized service for configuration management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naming: Distributed naming registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group Services: Facilitates group membership and leader/followers election.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZooKeeper is engineered with ultra large-scale systems, that require high
throughput, low latency, fault-tolerance, and high availability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Git</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 17:52:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/git/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Git is well-known as &amp;ldquo;the stupid content tracker&amp;rdquo; made by Linus Torvalds after
problems with BitKeeper licensing in early 2000s. It was designed to be fast,
efficient, and capable of handling large projects with ease - as Linux kernel

Long-Term Support (LTS) release, and it&amp;rsquo;s intended for end-users or
servers that only need to run pre-compiled Java applications. It
contains the core components, primarily the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
and core class libraries, but omits development tools like the
compiler (javac). Any application running on JRE 21 gains the benefits
of the JDK 21 platform, including the performance improvements from
the finalization of Virtual Threads and other new language features.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>JDK-21</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/jdk-21/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:31:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/jdk-21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;JDK 21 is the official Java Development Kit for the Java 21 Long-Term
Support (LTS) release, designed for application developers. It

(supporting Java, Kotlin, and Groovy) designed specifically for
building modular microservices and serverless applications. Its key
differentiator is that it performs dependency injection,
configuration, and aspect-oriented programming at compile time
(Ahead-of-Time compilation) rather than at runtime using reflection.
This results in dramatically faster startup times, a much lower memory
footprint, and makes it an ideal choice for serverless functions and
containerized microservices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maven</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/maven/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:03:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/maven/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Maven is a foundational software project management and build
automation tool. Using a central XML configuration file (the pom.xml),
Maven manages all project dependencies (downloading required libraries
from repositories) and executes a standardized build lifecycle (e.g.,
compile, test, package, install, deploy). This
convention-over-configuration approach simplifies the build process,
making it reproducible and standard across all Java-based projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manageiq</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:59:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ManageIQ is an open-source cloud management platform (CMP) that

communicate with and manage a Kubernetes cluster. It communicates with
the Kubernetes API server to execute commands. Administrators and
developers use this utility for nearly all cluster operations,
including deploying applications (using .yaml manifests), checking the
status and logs of running pods (observability), managing node health,
and configuring all Kubernetes resources like services, deployments,
and secrets.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kong</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/kong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:47:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/kong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kong is a cloud-native API gateway and platform built on top of Nginx
(specifically OpenResty). It is deployed in front of backend
microservices to act as a single, controllable entry point for all API
traffic. Its core function is to provide a comprehensive security and
management layer, handling tasks like authentication (OAuth2, JWT),
authorization, rate limiting, and traffic transformation via a

Oracle for building microservices. It provides two distinct paths for
development. Helidon SE is a lightweight, &amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;rdquo; toolkit that uses
a functional, non-blocking approach (built on Netty) for maximum
performance and a small footprint. Helidon MP is a full implementation
of the Eclipse MicroProfile specification, providing a more
declarative, annotation-driven programming model (similar to Spring
Boot or Micronaut) for enterprise Java developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GCC-13</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/gcc-13/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:41:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/gcc-13/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;GCC 13, the GNU Compiler Collection, is the foundational toolchain for

compiler for the GNU project. This release is notable for its
significant progress on the C++23 standard, implementing new features
like static operator() and import std;. It also enhances its support
for modern hardware, introducing improved code generation for new Arm
and RISC-V processor extensions, and expands its parallelism
capabilities with deeper support for the OpenMP 5.1 and 5.2 standards.
It translates human-readable source code into the optimized machine
code required for all open-source compilation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GCC-15</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/gcc-15/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:41:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/gcc-15/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;GCC 15, the GNU Compiler Collection, serves as the critical compiler
toolchain for most Linux distributions. This version marks a major
milestone by officially changing the default C language standard from
GNU17 to GNU23. It also dramatically expands its language support by
introducing a new front-end for the COBOL programming language. As a
core component of open-source development, it translates source code
into optimized machine code while providing powerful new features like
incremental Link-Time Optimization (LTO) to speed up builds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GCC-16</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/gcc-16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:41:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/gcc-16/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;GCC 16, representing the current development trunk of the GNU Compiler
Collection, is the next major iteration of the foundational
open-source toolchain. As the default compiler for the Linux
ecosystem, its development is focused on pushing language standards
forward, primarily by introducing experimental support for the
upcoming C++26 standard (such as std::function_ref). It continues to
be the critical utility that translates human-readable C, C++, and
other languages into the optimized machine code that powers the
open-source world, with a focus on new optimization techniques and
hardware support.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CloudNativePG-16</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/cnpg-16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:30:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/cnpg-16/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;CloudNativePG (CNPG) is a Kubernetes operator designed by PostgreSQL
