(supporting Java, Kotlin, and Groovy) designed specifically for
building modular microservices and serverless applications. Its key
differentiator is that it performs dependency injection,
configuration, and aspect-oriented programming at compile time
(Ahead-of-Time compilation) rather than at runtime using reflection.
This results in dramatically faster startup times, a much lower memory
footprint, and makes it an ideal choice for serverless functions and
containerized microservices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manageiq</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:59:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ManageIQ is an open-source cloud management platform (CMP) that
provides a single interface for managing hybrid IT environments. It

&amp;ldquo;Control&amp;rdquo; (security, compliance, policy enforcement), and &amp;ldquo;Automate&amp;rdquo;
(provisioning workflows, orchestration). It essentially acts as a
&amp;ldquo;manager of managers,&amp;rdquo; giving administrators a single pane of glass
for governance and automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kong</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/kong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:47:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/kong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kong is a cloud-native API gateway and platform built on top of Nginx
(specifically OpenResty). It is deployed in front of backend
microservices to act as a single, controllable entry point for all API
traffic. Its core function is to provide a comprehensive security and

authorization, rate limiting, and traffic transformation via a
&amp;ldquo;plugin&amp;rdquo; architecture. By intercepting and proxying all requests, Kong
also provides critical observability metrics, logs, and traces for
monitoring API performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helidon</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/helidon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:33:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/helidon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helidon is an open-source, cloud-native set of Java libraries from
