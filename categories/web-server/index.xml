(supporting Java, Kotlin, and Groovy) designed specifically for
building modular microservices and serverless applications. Its key
differentiator is that it performs dependency injection,
configuration, and aspect-oriented programming at compile time
(Ahead-of-Time compilation) rather than at runtime using reflection.
This results in dramatically faster startup times, a much lower memory
footprint, and makes it an ideal choice for serverless functions and
containerized microservices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Manageiq</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:59:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/manageiq/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ManageIQ is an open-source cloud management platform (CMP) that
provides a single interface for managing hybrid IT environments. It
discovers and monitors resources across disparate virtualization (like
VMware), private cloud (like OpenStack), and public cloud (like AWS,
Azure) platforms, as well as container platforms like Kubernetes. Its
key features include &amp;ldquo;Insight&amp;rdquo; (discovery, monitoring, analytics),
&amp;ldquo;Control&amp;rdquo; (security, compliance, policy enforcement), and &amp;ldquo;Automate&amp;rdquo;
(provisioning workflows, orchestration). It essentially acts as a
&amp;ldquo;manager of managers,&amp;rdquo; giving administrators a single pane of glass
for governance and automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kong</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/kong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:47:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/kong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kong is a cloud-native API gateway and platform built on top of Nginx
(specifically OpenResty). It is deployed in front of backend
microservices to act as a single, controllable entry point for all API
traffic. Its core function is to provide a comprehensive security and
management layer, handling tasks like authentication (OAuth2, JWT),
authorization, rate limiting, and traffic transformation via a
&amp;ldquo;plugin&amp;rdquo; architecture. By intercepting and proxying all requests, Kong
also provides critical observability metrics, logs, and traces for
monitoring API performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helidon</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/helidon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 15:33:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/helidon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Helidon is an open-source, cloud-native set of Java libraries from
Oracle for building microservices. It provides two distinct paths for
development. Helidon SE is a lightweight, &amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;rdquo; toolkit that uses
a functional, non-blocking approach (built on Netty) for maximum
performance and a small footprint. Helidon MP is a full implementation
of the Eclipse MicroProfile specification, providing a more
declarative, annotation-driven programming model (similar to Spring
Boot or Micronaut) for enterprise Java developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Apicast</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/apicast/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 14:04:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/apicast/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Apicast is the core API gateway component of the 3scale API Management
platform. It is a high-performance, Nginx-based proxy that processes
and controls all inbound API traffic. It intercepts requests,
authenticates them against defined policies (like rate limits, access
keys, or JWTs), and routes them to the correct upstream service. It&amp;rsquo;s
designed to be deployed as a container, managing the secure and
observable flow of communication between API consumers and backend
services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ArgoCD</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/argocd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:40:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/argocd/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ArgoCD is a declarative, version-controlled application deployment
tool designed to automate and manage application configurations and
environments. It follows the GitOps pattern, utilizing Git
repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired
application state. Users can specify Kubernetes manifests using
various methods such as kustomize applications, Helm charts, JSONnet
files, or plain directories of YAML/json manifests. ArgoCD automates
the deployment process based on the desired application state defined
in Git repositories, making application deployment and lifecycle
management easy, auditable, and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Harbor</title><link>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/harbor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:55:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sourcemation.com/catalog/harbor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Harbor operates as a platform enabling the management of container
