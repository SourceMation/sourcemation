process. The SCARE acronym stands for <strong>S</strong>oftware <strong>C</strong>omponent <strong>A</strong>nalysis for <strong>R</strong>isk <strong>E</strong>ngineering.</p><h4>Mathematical Model for Security Assessment</h4><p>The mathematical model is based on a cascading (hierarchical) calculation of the weighted average for a set of risk
factors that affect the analyzed component. These factors include the project contributor profile, CVSS score, and
project language profile rating. The term ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù is a general designation for any entity that groups or constitutes
an independent IT artifact, such as a binary, software package, operating system, or a Helm chart.</p><figure><img src=/sourcemation/images/risk-analysis/scare-3.png alt="Scare Model Diagram"></figure><p>According to the diagram, the following interpretation applies:</p><ol><li><strong>Rectangles</strong> correspond to the project assessment, determined by averaging the scores of their respective risk
factor categories, e.g., ‚Äúcvss score (component #1)‚Äù.</li><li><strong>Ovals</strong> correspond to the assessment of individual factors, which in particular cases are also determined based on
the weighted average of dependent factors, e.g., assessments of individual contributors.</li><li>The final risk assessment of a given component (e.g., ‚Äúcomponent #1‚Äù) considers all dependent factors (e.g., CVSS,
contributor profile) and the assessment of each of the dependent components (projects).</li></ol><h4>The Applied Mathematical Formula</h4><p>To determine a score, data from various sources must be prepared using statistical methods such as data scaling. This
method is used for both subject data and data used as weights in the scoring formula.</p><h4>Scaling</h4><p>Input data is scaled to a predetermined value range.</p>$$x \in R$$
$$\max{x} \neq \min{x}$$
$$x' = \frac{x - \min{x}}{\max{x} - \min{x}}$$<p>However, due to the marginalization of the minimum value (which is significant from an analysis standpoint), causing a
distortion in the distance between scaled values (by losing the reference point), the minimum value is set to 0.
Therefore, the final formula takes the following form:</p>$$x \geq 0$$
$$\max{x} \neq 0$$
$$x' = \frac{x}{\max{x}}$$<p>Alternatively, for features with positive values, uneven distribution, and a significant number of outliers, logarithmic
scaling should be applied.</p>$$x' = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(\max{x})}$$<p>It‚Äôs important to note that when using logarithmic scaling, a constant (e.g., 1) can be added to the value to exclude
values smaller than 1. This will have an insignificant impact on the assessment, which is relative in nature.</p>$$x \in R$$
$$x \geq 0$$
$$\max{x} > 0$$
$$x' = \frac{\ln(x + 1)}{\ln(\max{x} + 1)}$$<h4 id=average-weighted>Average Weighted</h4><p>Let the dataset be:</p>$$[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$$<p>a set of data with non-negative weights, with at least one being non-zero, respectively:</p>$$[w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n].$$<p>The arithmetic weighted average is used.</p>$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i},$$<p>So, it is:</p>$$\bar{x} = \frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \ldots + w_n x_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \ldots + w_n}.$$<p>This way, data with higher weights have a greater contribution to the weighted average.</p><p>According to the above, for set ùê¥ representing the set of ordered pairs of ratings (ùëü) and weights (ùë§) of dependent
components, and ùêµ representing the set of ratings and weights of the subject component‚Äôs risk categories, and ùúé
representing the statistical ‚Äúenhancement‚Äù parameter, the assessment of the subject component is determined by the
formula:</p>$$r, w, \sigma \in R$$
$$r, w \in \langle 0, 1 \rangle; \sigma \geqslant 1$$
$$A = \{(r_1, w_1), (r_2, w_2), \ldots, (r_n, w_n)\}$$
$$B = \{(r_1, w_1), (r_2, w_2), \ldots, (r_m, w_m)\}$$
$$\bar{s} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i_1} a_{i_2} + \sum_{j=1}^m \sigma b_{j_1} b_{j_2}}{\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i_2} + \sum_{j=1}^m \sigma b_{j_2}}$$<p>Statistical enhancement allows for increasing the significance (impact) of the ratings of the subject component‚Äôs risk
categories and balancing the influence of the ratings of dependent components. This formula is used in the same manner
for each level of dependency.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Like all models, the SCARE model has its limitations. It is important to remember that the model‚Äôs effectiveness depends
on the quality and completeness of the input data. It can be challenging even with open-source software, where data may be
incomplete, outdated or just not available. Additionally, the model may not account for all possible risk factors,
especially those that are specific to certain industries or use cases.</p><p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that our SCARE model is not static. It is continuously updated and improved based on new data and
feedback from users. Lastly the SCARE is complimentary tool to assist in risk assessment, and should not
be the sole basis for making decisions about software security.</p><figure><img src=/sourcemation/images/risk-analysis/scare-2.png alt="Scare Model Diagram"></figure></div></article></main><div class=footer-after></div><div class=site-footer><section class="footer-links container"><div class=col-1>¬© 2024-2025 Sourcemation, ¬© 2024-2025 LinuxPolska Sp. z o.o.<br><a href=#>Terms of use</a> | <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a></div><div class=col-2>Made in Europe</div></section><section class="footer-links credits container"><div class=col-1><p>The Sourcemation project (Risk analyzing system for open-source components' based sofware) is co-financed by the European Regional
