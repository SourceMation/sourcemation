immense flexibility but also new security challenges. As adoption grows,
robust security practices are no longer optional they&amp;rsquo;re critical.
While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to rely on individual users to adopt good
practices, this approach is often unrealistic. Security measures often
add complexity to developers&amp;rsquo; workflows, raising the barrier for
project onboarding and delivery. From their perspective, ensuring the
application functions correctly is the top priority, while security
often takes a back seat. An effective solution is a tool that
automatically verifies which objects are being applied to the cluster
and how. In other words, Kubernetes administrators should be empowered
to automatically control what is applied. One promising solution is
&lt;strong&gt;Kyverno&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
